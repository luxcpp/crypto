# Cryptographic Concepts

This section covers the theoretical foundations and design principles of the cryptographic primitives implemented in lux-crypto.

## Overview

lux-crypto implements a carefully selected set of cryptographic primitives optimized for blockchain and zero-knowledge applications:

| Primitive | Use Case | Security Level |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| BLS12-381 | Aggregate signatures, pairings | 128-bit |
| BN254 | zk-SNARKs, efficient pairings | 100-bit |
| BLAKE3 | Fast hashing, Merkle trees | 256-bit |
| ML-DSA | Post-quantum signatures | NIST Level 2/3/5 |
| KZG | Polynomial commitments | 128-bit |

## Design Principles

### 1. GPU-First Architecture

All computationally intensive operations leverage Metal compute shaders for maximum throughput on Apple Silicon:

- **Field arithmetic** - Montgomery multiplication in parallel
- **Multi-scalar multiplication (MSM)** - Pippenger's algorithm on GPU
- **FFT/NTT** - Radix-2 transforms for polynomial operations
- **Hash computation** - Parallel BLAKE3 tree hashing

### 2. Constant-Time Operations

Security-critical operations are implemented in constant time to prevent timing side-channel attacks:

```cpp
// All comparison and conditional operations use constant-time primitives
bool ct_equal(const uint8_t* a, const uint8_t* b, size_t len) {
    uint8_t diff = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        diff |= a[i] ^ b[i];
    }
    return diff == 0;
}
```

### 3. Memory Safety

The library uses RAII patterns and smart pointers to prevent memory leaks and use-after-free vulnerabilities:

```cpp
class SecureBuffer {
    std::unique_ptr<uint8_t[]> data;
    size_t size;
public:
    ~SecureBuffer() {
        // Secure erase on destruction
        std::memset(data.get(), 0, size);
    }
};
```
